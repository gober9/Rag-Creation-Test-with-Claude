# Implementation Details of RAG Model Project

## What Was Created

I created a foundational RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model project structure using the following components:

### Repository Setup
- Created GitHub repository: Rag-Creation-Test-with-Claude
- Initialized with a main branch
- Added necessary project files:
  1. `package.json`: Defines project dependencies
  2. `createRAGModel.js`: Initial RAG model script
  3. `README.md`: Basic project documentation

### Local Setup and Execution

#### Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 14+ recommended)
2. Install Git
3. Have a compatible Llama model downloaded

#### Step-by-Step Local Setup

1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gober9/Rag-Creation-Test-with-Claude.git
cd Rag-Creation-Test-with-Claude
```

2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure Model Paths
Open `createRAGModel.js` and update:
```javascript
const model = new Llama({
  modelPath: "/absolute/path/to/your/llama/model",
  tokenizerPath: "/absolute/path/to/your/llama/tokenizer"
});
```

4. Run the Script
```bash
npm start
```

### Potential Local Environment Challenges
- Ensure exact library versions match your system
- Some Llama models require specific GPU configurations
- SHAP might need additional scientific computing libraries

### Troubleshooting
- Check Node.js version compatibility
- Verify all dependencies are correctly installed
- Confirm model paths are absolute and correct
- Check console for specific error messages

## Current Limitations
- Basic implementation without advanced RAG features
- Placeholder model generation logic
- Minimal error handling
- No advanced retrieval mechanism
